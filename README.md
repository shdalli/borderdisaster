# borderdisaster

The Border Disaster Project explores the relationship between natural disasters and U.S. border activity. Using publicly available datasets from FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), this project investigates how federally declared disasters affect cross-border traffic flows (e.g., personal vehicles, trucks, buses, pedestrians) at U.S.–Canada and U.S.–Mexico borders.

The analysis combines spatial-temporal techniques, statistical modeling, and machine learning approaches to quantify disruptions and identify long-term patterns.
